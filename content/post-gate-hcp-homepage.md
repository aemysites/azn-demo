\* Study ZS-004 (n=258): Open-label, uncontrolled, 48-hour correction phase study of patients with hyperkalemia receiving 10 g of LOKELMA administered 3x daily (TID) for 48 hours. Normokalemia defined as serum K+ of 3.5–5.0 mmol/L.<sup>1</sup>

† Study ZS-005 (n=751): Open-label, uncontrolled, two-phase, long-term (up to 12 mo.) study. Correction phase: LOKELMA 10 g TID over 72 hrs. Patients normokalemic within 72 hrs (n=746) entered maintenance phase (days 8–365): LOKELMA 5 g QD, titrated in 5 g increments down to 5 g QOD or up to 15 g QD (not a recommended dose) based on titration regimen.<sup>1</sup>

‡ Serum potassium should be monitored when clinically indicated, including after changes to medications that affect serum potassium levels (e.g., use of RAAS inhibitors or diuretics) and after the LOKELMA dose is titrated.<sup>1</sup>
